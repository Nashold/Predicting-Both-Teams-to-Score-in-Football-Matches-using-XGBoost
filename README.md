# Predicting-Both-Teams-to-Score-in-Football-Matches-using-XGBoost

Introduction

This guide will walk you through a complete end-to-end process for predicting whether both teams will score (BTTS) in a football match using machine learning, specifically the XGBoost algorithm. We will preprocess the data, train a model using hyperparameter tuning, and make predictions for future matches.





This guide covered data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and making predictions for future football matches using an XGBoost classifier. You can now apply similar techniques to different datasets or further improve the model with more features and advanced tuning.
